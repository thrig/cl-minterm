cl-minterm - a wafer-thin terminal library for Common LISP (cl-charms or
cl-blt or cl-sdl2 may be more sensible options?) that sets a terminal to
raw mode and provides a few ANSI/XTerm Control Sequence related routines


INSTALLATION

install for ASDF; this requires that CFFI (etc) are available:

    mkdir -p "$HOME"/.local/share/common-lisp/source
    cd "$HOME"/.local/share/common-lisp/source
    git clone https://github.com/thrig/cl-minterm

or install for Quicklisp:

    cd "$HOME"/quicklisp/local-projects
    git clone https://github.com/thrig/cl-minterm


SYNOPSIS

    ;(require :asdf)
    ;(asdf:load-system :cl-minterm)
    #-quicklisp
    (let ((quicklisp-init
           (merge-pathnames "quicklisp/setup.lisp" (user-homedir-pathname))))
      (when (probe-file quicklisp-init) (load quicklisp-init)))
    (ql:quickload :cl-minterm :silent t)

    (defpackage :synopsis (:use :cl :cl-minterm))
    (in-package :synopsis)

    (define-condition game-over (error)
      ((reason :initarg :reason :reader game-over-reason)))

    (defun game-loop ()
      (multiple-value-bind (rows cols) (term-size)
        (at 1 rows)
        (format t "~dx~d" cols rows))
      (at 1 1)
      (color 255 0 0 1)
      (princ 'text)
      (force-output)
      (case (getch)
        (#\q (error 'game-over :reason :quit-game))))

    (defun start-game ()
      (handler-case
        (unwind-protect
          (with-rawterm 0 0 (setup-screen +hide-cursor+ +hide-pointer+)
                        (game-loop))
          (restore-screen +clear-right+))
       (game-over (msg)
         (let ((reason (game-over-reason msg)))
           (case reason
             (:quit-game (princ "Be seeing you..."))
             (otherwise (princ "Well, I guess it's over."))))))
      #+DARWIN
      (princ #\Return))


PORTABILITY

portability is untested beyond SBCL on OpenBSD 6.6 and Mac OS X 10.11.
the "action" key to WITH-RAWTERM may not be portable; check termios.h
for details


CAVEATS

behavior will depend on the LISP and what configuration is done in
that; the terminal may not be restored to the correct state in all
cases. the REPL and any debugger may need to be be completely disabled
for best results:

    sbcl --noinform --end-runtime-options \
      --disable-debugger --noprint --script ...

the interface has and may change without notice
