cl-minterm - a wafer-thin terminal library for Common LISP (cl-charms
may be a more sensible option?) that sets a terminal to raw mode

install for ASDF, e.g.

  mkdir -p "$HOME"/.local/share/common-lisp/source
  cd "$HOME"/.local/share/common-lisp/source
  git clone ...

this also requires CFFI (and its depedencies) to be available; another
way would be to symlink this directory into ~/quicklisp/local-projects
and then use Quicklisp instead of ASDF directly

typical leading values for with-rawterm would be 0 for STDIN_FILENO
(should be portable) and 0 for TCSANOW (may not be portable? check
termios.h) e.g.

  (require :asdf)
  (asdf:load-system :cl-minterm)
  (defpackage :foo (:use :cl :cl-minterm))
  (in-package :foo)
  (with-rawterm 0 0
    (format t "~a" 'raw)
    (finish-output)
    (read-char))
  (format t "~a~%" 'back)

portability has not been checked beyond SBCL on OpenBSD 6.5
